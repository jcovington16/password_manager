For each login that we want to save we need to have a list of things
- username
- password
- url to the site you are logging into

Here are the different things that needs to happen
- user puts in username and password
- we need to ensure that the password gets encrypted when stored
- when we want to login to a site we need to be able to put in the url site
    and then decrypt the password.
